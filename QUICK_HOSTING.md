# 🚀 Quick Hosting Guide for Play Console

You need to host your `privacy-policy.html` and `delete-account.html` files so Google Play can access them.

- Click "uploading an existing file"
- Upload from `docs/` folder:

### 3. Enable Pages
- Settings → Pages
- Source: `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder
